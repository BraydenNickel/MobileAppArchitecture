Mobile App Architecture
Brayden Nickel

Issue: Choose the architectural design for the development of a mobile app. Consider the requirements
the app will have. Such as offline mode, push notifications, payment gateway, analytics, image handling and internationalization

Decision: The mobile app for the retail company will have the following components

Status: Approved

Group: Mobile App Architecture

Assumptions:
- The app will be developed using a cross platform framework
- The app will be developed to ensure flexibility and scalability
- The app will have integrated features for push notifications and analytics
- The app will be secure to handle payment transactions
- The app will be optimized to handle imaging and localization

Constraints:
- Time and resources may impact the quality
- Budget may impact the choice of APIs
- The selected cross platform framework should support requirements

Positions:
- Use a cross platform framework like React Native
- Implement offline mode with data synchronization
- Integrate a push notification service like Google's Firebase cloud messaging
- Select a payment gateway like Square
- Use Google Analytics for data
- Use lazy loading for image optimization
- Implement localization with an appropriate library for React Native

Argument:
- Cross Platform Framework: React Native is chosen to target multiple platforms and help reduce development time
- Offline Mode: Offline mode with data synchronization so users can access essential features with no internet
- Push Notifications: Using Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging to communicate order status updates with users
- Payment Gateway: Using Square API for security, cross platform compatibilities, payment options and ongoing support/updates
- Analytics: Using Google Analytics will provide insight to user behavior
- Image Optimization: Implement lazy loading for image optimization to ensure app performance
- Localization: Use react-native-localization to support various languages and preferences

Implications:
- Integrate third party services for push notifications, payment gateway and analytics may require ongoing support
- Security measures must be implemented for payment transactions, Square API can handle this
- Performance optimized will improve user experience due to app speed and responsiveness
- Localization will be used to adapting content for different countries
